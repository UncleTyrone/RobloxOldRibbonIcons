# RobloxOldRibbonIcons
A configuration of the Roblox Studio new-gen UI topbar which matches the layout as previously seen in older versions of Roblox Studio.

Forked from the [original repository](https://github.com/TenebrisNoctua/RibbonTools/tree/main/OldRibbonTabs). This edit fixes some of the aligning issues with different resolutions of Roblox Studio and also includes a pre-defined formatting file which tells your Roblox Studio which tabs to disable and which ones to keep. The releases contain a package of .json files which should be installed into your local files accordingly.

## Installation
To Install, go to:

```
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\<userID>\CustomRibbonTabs
MacOS: ~/Documents/Roblox/<userID>/CustomRibbonTabs
```

Drop all of the .json files to the CustomRibbonTabs folder. Then, reload your Roblox Studio and they should all appear. After that, you can reorder or disable any of them if you wish.

Enjoy!
